\section{Introduction and Background on BioImpedance (BioZ)}

In the interdisciplinary domain of biomedical engineering and wearable technology, the development and optimization of electrode technology are critical for advancing non-invasive diagnostic methods and facilitating innovative communication modalities through the human body. This article embarks on a critical examination of various electrodes presently available, with a particular focus on their application in electrocardiography (ECG). Beyond traditional uses, our exploration extends to assessing these electrodes' compatibility with BioImpedance (BioZ) and Body-Coupled Communication (BCC)—two areas burgeoning with potential to revolutionize healthcare monitoring and data transmission directly through the human body.

BioImpedance (BioZ) stands out as a non-invasive technique that quantifies the electrical impedance of biological tissues. By applying a minor electrical current through the body and measuring the resultant voltage response, BioZ offers invaluable insights into the body's composition and physiological state. This method is predicated on the principle that different biological tissues—such as blood, muscle, and fat—possess unique electrical characteristics. The ability to discern these properties allows for a profound understanding of an individual's health status and facilitates the management of various medical conditions.

The utility of BioZ spans a wide array of medical applications, making it a cornerstone of modern non-invasive diagnostic approaches. It serves as an essential tool for body composition analysis, enabling the precise estimation of parameters such as fat mass, lean muscle mass, and total body water. This capability is indispensable in fields ranging from nutritional assessment and obesity management to optimizing athletic performance. Furthermore, BioZ's role extends to assessing hydration status, cardiac output, and pulmonary fluid content, offering critical insights for managing kidney diseases, heart failure, and pulmonary conditions, respectively.

The success of BioZ and BCC hinges on the ability to ensure excellent contact quality and maintain low impedance at the electrode-skin interface. These factors are paramount for achieving accurate and reliable measurements. Good electrode contact ensures uniform current distribution across the measurement site, minimizing errors and enhancing measurement sensitivity. This sensitivity is crucial for detecting subtle physiological changes, potentially signaling early disease stages or health risk factors. Moreover, in BCC applications, low interface impedance is vital for efficient signal transmission through the body, optimizing communication range and quality while conserving power.

As we delve into the comparative analysis of electrode performance, this article illuminates the criteria employed for evaluation—such as sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency stability—across BioZ and BCC applications. This inquiry transcends mere identification of suitable electrodes; it seeks to unravel the reasons behind the superior performance of certain electrodes in these specialized applications. Concluding with a discussion on the implications of our findings for future electrode development, this study aims to contribute significantly to the ongoing refinement of electrode technology. This advancement is expected to enhance diagnostic capabilities and introduce novel communication methods through the human body, marking a pivotal step forward in the intersection of biomedical engineering and wearable technologies.



\section{Literature Review}

Cardiovascular diseases are major global health concerns, driving the need for advanced monitoring technologies. Bioimpedance measurement (BioZ) has emerged as a key technique for non-invasively monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs. Its integration into wearable devices offers the potential for continuous health monitoring outside clinical settings, which is vital for patient care and disease management \cite{OriginalSource1, towards, NewSource1}.

Recent advancements in electrode technology have played a crucial role in the development of BioZ and BCC. Novel electrode materials and structures have been developed to improve adhesion to the skin and effective signal collection. These advancements include the use of composite dry electrodes and novel structures for flexible and wearable sensors, which are essential for efficient biosignal detection \cite{PubMedArticle, NewSource2}.

In BCC, the focus has been on optimizing communication through the human body. Studies have explored various aspects such as the type of coupling (capacitive versus galvanic), the optimal frequency range, and the impact of electrode placement and shape on signal strength. For eHealth applications, galvanic coupling is often preferred due to its privacy and interference-resilience properties \cite{electrode_comp, NewSource3}. The operational frequency range for BCC has been found to be most efficient between 1MHz and 100 MHz, with the optimal frequency varying depending on electrode placement \cite{electrode_comp, NewSource4}.

The challenges in developing bioimpedance-enabled wearable devices are multifaceted. They include selecting appropriate electrodes, their configuration, power supply, weight, and ensuring accuracy while maintaining user convenience \cite{OriginalSource1, towards, NewSource5}. The trade-off between the accuracy of tetrapolar electrode setups and the practicality of bipolar setups for wearable technology is a significant consideration in current research \cite{towards, NewSource6}.

Notable studies in the field have investigated various aspects of wearable bioimpedance devices. For instance, research has been conducted on optimizing electrode location, assessing device performance depending on electrode characteristics, and applying heart rate detection algorithms to bioimpedance measurements \cite{towards, PubMedArticle, NewSource7}. Alharbi et al.'s large-scale study with 51 test subjects is a notable example, validating multi-stage signal processing procedures for heartbeat detection \cite{towards, NewSource8}.

This work presents an experimental study examining the impact of electrode type for heart rate monitoring from bioimpedance signals obtained on the wrist. Our approach, focusing on a bipolar electrode setup, aims to strike a balance between measurement accuracy and user convenience, potentially enabling smaller and more user-friendly wearable devices \cite{towards}.

\section{Why Gold electrodes are the best}
{
In comparing reusable gold-plated copper electrodes to disposable Ag/AgCl electrodes for BioZ and BCC (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Body Composition Analysis) applications, the advantages of the former over the latter are evident in several key aspects, supported by scientific research.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Material Properties and Sensitivity}: Gold-plated copper electrodes exhibit enhanced electrochemical stability and sensitivity due to the superior conductivity and biocompatibility of gold. This property is critical for BioZ and BCC applications, where precise and stable signal acquisition is essential for accurate body composition and impedance measurements. Gold's inert nature also reduces the likelihood of electrode oxidation and degradation, ensuring consistent performance over time, a feature not as pronounced in Ag/AgCl electrodes \href{https://consensus.app/papers/amino-acid-analysis-using-copper-nanoparticle-plated-zen/95f4e51b52de5e0081608398a7922a14/?utm_source=chatgpt}{(Zen et al., 2004)}.
