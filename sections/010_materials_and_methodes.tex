\section{Materials and Methods}

To develop the benchmark for electrodes in BioZ and BCC application, first of all we need to identify what are the parameters we are seeking. In other words, if we have ideal signal, what are parameters of that signal, and what changes of those parameters would lead to reduction of quality of the signal.

Starting our thought experiment with pure sine wave, with zero noise, and amplitude high enought, so the smallest changes in that sine-wave would be captured by our ideal ADC.

Now lets observe real life measurements (See figures \ref{fig:agagcl_breathing}, \ref{fig:edigold_breathing}, \ref{fig:movsense_breathing}) and try to identify what are those elements that separates real world form ideal.

Looking at \ref{fig:agagcl_breathing}, we see that "amplitude of inhale-exhale" is about 5 ohms, the measurement drifts from 1.72KOhm to 1.695KOhms over one minute. There is insignificant noise, about 0.1 Ohm and breathing pattern is clearly visible.

Looking at \ref{fig:edigold_breathing}, we see that "amplitude of inhale-exhale" is about 5 ohms, the measurement drifts from 734Ohm to 736Ohms over one minute. There is insignificant noise, about 0.1 Ohm and breathing pattern is clearly visible.

Looking at \ref{fig:movsense_breathing}, we are unable to see "amplitude of inhale-exhale", the measurement have no significant drift. There is drastic noise and artifacts, breathing pattern is not visible.

From those observations we can conclude that we are looking for electrodes that provides stable, low-noise, high amplitude signal.

So, to evaluate the electrodes, we will need to move from qualitative to quantitative analysis. firs of all we need to define the parameters that we are going to measure.

our proposal is to measure:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Amplitude of inhale-exhale
    \item Drift of the measurement
    \item Noise
    \item SNR
    \item Artifacts
    \item Breathing pattern visibility
    \item Heartbeat pattern visibility
    \item Muscle activity pattern visibility
    \item Skin impedance (atkartojamÄ«ba)
\end{itemize}
