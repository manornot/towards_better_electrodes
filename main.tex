\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Electrode Types}
This study investigates the performance of four distinct electrode types in bioimpedance measurements and \gls{BCC} applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classical Ag/AgCl Disposable Electrodes:} Predominantly used in \gls{ECG}  for their excellent electrical conductivity and stable electrochemical properties. These electrodes, featuring a silver base coated with silver chloride, facilitate the accurate transduction of ionic to electronic current, essential for high-fidelity cardiac signal acquisition.
    
    \item \textbf{Reusable EMS electrodes:} These electrodes enhance skin adherence and moisture retention, potentially improving long-term signal stability and comfort.
    
    \item \textbf{Custom-Made Gold-Plated Copper Electrodes on Flexible PCB:} Offer superior durability, reusability, and biocompatibility, aimed at reducing environmental impact and operational costs.
    
\end{itemize}

Each electrode type's construction and material properties uniquely contribute to its performance in specific biomedical applications, from standard \gls{ECG} measurements to innovative \gls{BCC} functionalities. 

%%\notea{Also describe size and shapes of the electrodes.}

\subsection{Measurement Scenarios}
We focused on three primary scenarios to evaluate electrode performance:

\subsubsection{Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Heart Rate monitoring}
BPG serves as a fundamental application for assessing electrode efficacy, focusing on the \gls{SNR} and settling time. These parameters are critical for diagnosing cardiac conditions and ensuring the reliability of cardiac monitoring systems.

\subsubsection{Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis Pneumography}
Exploration of electrodes' performance in \gls{BioZ}   pneumography to understand their suitability for advanced healthcare monitoring. The emphasis is on evaluating electrodes under realistic conditions that mimic their intended use in wearable technologies and non-invasive diagnostic tools.

\subsubsection{Body-Coupled Communication Use-Case}
The Body Coupled Communication (BCC) technology presents a groundbreaking use-case for the electrodes under test, highlighting their role in enabling efficient and secure data transmission through the human body. \gls{BCC} technology utilizes the body as a conductive medium for electronic signals, offering a promising solution for wearable device interconnectivity and data exchange in personal healthcare systems. 



\subsection{Performance Evaluation Parameters}
This methodology aims to provide a robust framework for comparing the efficacy of various electrode types in biomedical applications, contributing to the development of more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly non-invasive diagnostic and communication technologies. 

The study quantitatively assesses electrode performance using the following metrics:

 \textbf{Signal-to-Noise Ratio:} Essential for determining the clarity and quality of bioimpedance signals and \gls{BCC} data transmission.
    The \gls{SNR} is calculated as the ratio of signal amplitude (averaging signal over time) to the standard deviation of the background noise, providing a quantitative measure of the signal's fidelity and integrity. A higher \gls{SNR} indicates a clearer, more reliable signal, essential for accurate data analysis and interpretation.
    
\textbf{Settling Time:} Measures the time electrodes take to stabilize their signal upon placement, indicating their readiness for immediate data acquisition.
    
    The settling time refers to the duration needed for a signal to stabilize, with variations no more than 5\% during one cycle of changes in a person's vital signs. This measurement is especially important for situations that demand quick preparation and instant signal capture, such as in emergency medical scenarios or ongoing health monitoring.
    
\textbf{\gls{CER}  for \gls{BCC} Application:} Assesses the reliability of data transmission through the body, reflecting the efficiency of electrode-based communication systems.
    
    The \gls{CER} is calculated as the ratio of the number of bit errors to the total number of bits transmitted, providing a quantitative measure of the data transmission quality. A lower \gls{CER} indicates a more reliable communication channel, essential for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of transmitted data in \gls{BCC} applications.
    
    %\item \textbf{Movement Artifacts:} Investigated through the ratio of \gls{CER} under active (with movement) and passive (no movement) conditions to quantify the impact of physical activity on data integrity.

\section{Results}

In this section, we outline the experimental outcomes from this comparison among Ag/AgCl electrodes, EMS electrodes, and gold-plated electrodes. The evaluation metrics included \gls{SNR} for both breathing and pulse signals, Settling Time for signal stabilization, and \gls{CER}  for \gls{BCC}. Instances where signal quality was insufficient for measurement are denoted by "-".

\subsection{Signal-to-Noise Ratio}

 \textbf{Breathing (Upper Arm):} The \gls{SNR} values for Ag/AgCl and EMS electrodes were 10 and 12, respectively, with gold-plated electrodes at a lower \gls{SNR} of 5.
 
\textbf{Breathing (Chest):} Gold-plated electrodes significantly outperformed with an \gls{SNR} of 30, against 10 for Ag/AgCl and 15 for EMS electrodes.

 \textbf{Pulse (Upper Arm):} Gold-plated electrodes exhibited a superior \gls{SNR} of 1, compared to 0.5 for Ag/AgCl electrodes, with EMS electrodes' signal being too poor to measure.

 \textbf{Pulse (Chest):} The \gls{SNR} for Ag/AgCl electrodes was slightly better at 1, versus 0.5 for gold-plated electrodes. The EMS electrodes' performance could not be measured.


\subsection{Settling Time}

 \textbf{Breathing (Upper Arm):} EMS electrodes demonstrated an instantaneous settling time (0 seconds), followed by gold-plated (10 seconds) and Ag/AgCl electrodes (30 seconds).
 
    \textbf{Breathing (Chest):} Gold-plated electrodes achieved the fastest settling time at 0 seconds, Ag/AgCl electrodes followed at 5 seconds, and EMS electrodes lagged at 20 seconds.
 
    \textbf{Pulse (Upper Arm):} Both Ag/AgCl and gold-plated electrodes registered a settling time of 2 seconds. EMS electrodes' quality was unmeasurable.

These experimental insights depict a nuanced landscape of electrode performance, where no single type consistently excels across all metrics. Notably, gold-plated electrodes demonstrate superior capability in specific scenarios, particularly in \gls{SNR} for chest breathing signals and the settling time for breathing signals, highlighting their application-specific advantages. However, their performance varied across the board, emphasizing the importance of tailored electrode choice based on precise application needs. The EMS electrodes faced challenges in reliable signal acquisition for some metrics, indicating their limitations in the tested scenarios.

%\section{Discussion}
%\subsection{Pulse Measurement Scenario Analysis}
%The pulse measurement scenario offers insightful observations into the comparative performance of Ag/AgCl electrodes, EMS electrodes, and gold-plated electrodes. This analysis is pivotal for understanding the implications of electrode choice in applications requiring precise cardiovascular monitoring.
%\textbf{Signal-to-Noise Ratio:} The \gls{SNR} is a critical factor in assessing the quality of the pulse signal captured by the electrodes. This results indicate that gold-plated electrodes tend to perform better on the upper arm with an \gls{SNR} of 1, compared to 0.5 for Ag/AgCl electrodes. This suggests that gold-plated electrodes may provide clearer signal quality in upper arm pulse measurements, which is essential for accurate heart rate monitoring. However, in chest measurements, Ag/AgCl electrodes slightly outperformed gold-plated ones (\gls{SNR} of 1 vs. 0.5), indicating that electrode placement and the specific monitoring site play a significant role in signal clarity. The absence of data for EMS electrodes in this scenario due to unmeasurable signal quality underscores the challenges that certain electrode types may face in specific physiological monitoring contexts.
%\textbf{Settling Time:} The rapid stabilization of the signal, as denoted by the settling time, is crucial for timely and efficient pulse monitoring. Both Ag/AgCl and gold-plated electrodes showed a settling time of 2 seconds on the upper arm, indicating a quick adaptation to the physiological signal. This quick settling time is advantageous in scenarios where immediate signal acquisition is necessary, such as in acute care settings. For chest measurements, gold-plated electrodes demonstrated a slightly better settling time (5 seconds) compared to Ag/AgCl electrodes (7 seconds), suggesting that for chest-based pulse measurements, gold-plated electrodes might be slightly more efficient in achieving signal stability.
%\textbf{Application Implications:} The choice between Ag/AgCl and gold-plated electrodes for pulse measurements should consider both the monitoring location and the specific requirements of the application. For upper arm measurements where higher \gls{SNR} is a priority, gold-plated electrodes appear to offer an advantage. Conversely, for chest measurements, the choice may depend on the balance between the need for slightly higher \gls{SNR} (favoring Ag/AgCl electrodes) and faster settling times (favoring gold-plated electrodes). The unavailability of data for EMS electrodes in pulse measurements suggests a limitation in their utility for reliable cardiovascular monitoring, highlighting the need for further research into electrode designs that can accommodate a broader range of measurement scenarios.
%Overall, the pulse measurement scenario underscores the nuanced trade-offs between electrode types, with no single electrode type emerging as universally superior across all metrics. This analysis illustrates the importance of context in electrode selection, where specific application needs and measurement site characteristics should guide the choice of electrodes. Further research into optimizing electrode materials and designs for specific physiological signals and monitoring locations could significantly enhance the efficacy and reliability of biomedical monitoring technologies.
%This section delves into the comparative analysis of \gls{BioZ}   pneumography measurements, focusing on the performance of Ag/AgCl electrodes, EMS electrodes, and gold-plated electrodes across different scenarios. Pneumography, the process of recording breathing patterns, is crucial in both clinical settings and wearable health technology. The efficacy of this measurement largely depends on the quality of the electrodes used for signal acquisition.
%\subsection{Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis   Pneumography Measurement Analysis}
%The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and settling time serve as critical parameters in evaluating the performance of electrodes in \gls{BioZ}   pneumography measurements. These metrics directly impact the reliability and accuracy of respiratory rate monitoring, a vital sign that is indicative of numerous health conditions.
%\subsubsection{Signal-to-Noise Ratio}
%\textbf{Upper Arm vs. Chest Measurements:} The experimental results highlight a stark difference in performance among the electrode types when used for pneumography. Notably, gold-plated electrodes exhibited superior \gls{SNR} in chest measurements with a value of 30, significantly outperforming both Ag/AgCl and EMS electrodes. This suggests that gold-plated electrodes are more adept at capturing the subtle changes in bioimpedance caused by breathing at the chest level, attributed to their enhanced conductivity and biocompatibility. However, in the upper arm scenario, the performance of gold-plated electrodes was the lowest with an \gls{SNR} of 5, which could be due to the reduced impact of thoracic movement on bioimpedance at this location.
%\textbf{Implications for Clinical and Wearable Applications:} The high \gls{SNR} of gold-plated electrodes in chest measurements underlines their potential in applications requiring high precision in respiratory rate monitoring, such as in patients with respiratory disorders or for sleep quality studies. Conversely, the lower \gls{SNR} observed in upper arm measurements across all electrode types suggests a potential limitation in scenarios where chest placement is not feasible.
%\subsubsection{Settling Time}
%\textbf{Rapid Signal Acquisition:} The settling time—how quickly a stable signal is obtained—was found to be minimal for gold-plated electrodes in chest measurements (0 seconds), indicating their suitability for scenarios requiring immediate data collection, such as emergency medical services or real-time health monitoring systems.
%\textbf{Upper Arm Measurements:} In contrast, for upper arm measurements, EMS electrodes demonstrated an immediate settling time of 0 seconds, suggesting that despite their lower SNR, they may offer advantages in scenarios where rapid setup and less precise respiratory monitoring are acceptable.
%\subsection{Overall Evaluation}
%The evaluation of \gls{BioZ}   pneumography measurements underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate electrode type based on the specific requirements of the application. Gold-plated electrodes, with their exceptional performance in chest measurements, emerge as a preferable choice for detailed respiratory analysis. However, the context of the measurement, including the location (chest vs. upper arm) and the need for rapid signal acquisition, plays a crucial role in determining the most suitable electrode type.
%In conclusion, this analysis reveals the nuanced trade-offs between electrode types in \gls{BioZ}   pneumography measurements. Future research should further explore these dynamics, potentially leading to the development of specialized electrodes tailored to specific measurement scenarios.
%\subsection{Body-Coupled Communication Application Analysis}
%In evaluating the efficacy of electrodes for \gls{BCC}, \gls{CER}  serves as a pivotal metric. \gls{BCC} leverages the human body as a medium for signal transmission, a novel approach that underpins many emerging applications in health monitoring and data transfer. The CER, which measures the rate of errors in the communication channel, directly impacts the reliability and efficiency of these applications.
%\subsubsection{\gls{CER} }
%\textbf{Comparative Analysis:} The experimental findings indicated that Ag/AgCl electrodes exhibited the lowest \gls{CER} at 3.30\%, followed by EMS electrodes at 5.20\%, and gold-plated electrodes at 5.50\%. This suggests that Ag/AgCl electrodes provide a more stable and reliable channel for body-coupled communication, likely due to their effective impedance matching with human skin, which is critical for minimizing signal loss and reflections.
%\textbf{Implications for \gls{BCC} Applications:} The lower \gls{CER} of Ag/AgCl electrodes highlights their potential in applications where high data integrity and minimal transmission errors are paramount. These scenarios include wearable health technologies that rely on the seamless exchange of physiological data between devices or remote monitoring systems where accuracy and reliability are crucial.
%However, the relatively higher \gls{CER} observed with gold-plated and EMS electrodes does not necessarily preclude their use in \gls{BCC} applications. The selection of electrodes must also consider factors such as biocompatibility, durability, and the specific communication requirements of the application. For instance, gold-plated electrodes, despite their higher CER, might still be preferred in long-term monitoring applications due to their superior biocompatibility and resistance to corrosion. 
%\subsubsection{Strategic Considerations for Electrode Selection in BCC}
%The nuanced performance differences among electrode types in \gls{BCC} applications underscore the importance of strategic electrode selection. Developers and researchers should weigh the trade-offs between CER, biocompatibility, durability, and economic factors to determine the most suitable electrode type for their specific application. Moreover, the evolving landscape of \gls{BCC} technology may necessitate ongoing evaluation as new electrode materials and designs emerge. As to \gls{BCC} technology relies on long-term wearability and user comfort, these factors are equally important in electrode selection. In glance of the results and very insignificant diferences in CERs, the choice of electrode type for \gls{BCC} applications may fall to reusable EMS and gold-plated electrodes, as they offer a balance between performance and durability.
%In conclusion, this analysis of \gls{BCC} applications reveals a complex interplay between electrode material properties and communication performance. While Ag/AgCl electrodes currently offer the lowest CER, the broader context of application requirements must guide the final electrode selection. Future advancements in electrode technology and \gls{BCC} methodologies hold the promise of further enhancing the efficacy of body-coupled communication in healthcare and beyond.
